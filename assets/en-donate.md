<summary>Donate</summary>

As a freelancer (currently working as a contractor) and a dad of three kids, I truly appreciate your donation to support my writing and open-source software development! Your contribution helps me cope with financial uncertainty better, so I can spend more time on producing high-quality content and software. You can make a donation through methods below.

- Venmo: `@yihui_xie`, or Zelle: `xie@yihui.name`

- Paypal

  - If you have a Paypal account, you can follow the link https://paypal.me/YihuiXie or find me on Paypal via my email `xie@yihui.name`. Please choose the payment type as "Family and Friends" (instead of "Goods and Services") to avoid extra fees.
  
  - If you don't have Paypal, you may donate through [this link](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?business=ZRJDEBSEJEUJY&no_recurring=0&item_name=Thank+you+for+supporting+my+writing+on+https%3A%2F%2Fyihui.org&currency_code=USD) via your debit or credit card. Paypal will charge a fee on my side.

When sending money, _please be sure to add a note "gift" or "donation"_ if possible, so it won't be treated as my taxable income but a genuine gift. Needless to say, donation is completely voluntary and I appreciate any amount you can give.

Please feel free to email me if you prefer a different way to give. Thank you very much!

I'll give back a significant portion of the donations to the open-source community and charities. For the record, I received about $30,000 in total (before tax) in 2024-25, and gave back about $15,000 (after tax).
