Demonstration of the Quincunx (Bean Machine/Galton Box)

Simulates the quincunx with ``balls'' (beans) falling through several layers
(denoted by triangles) and the distribution of the final locations at which
the balls hit is denoted by a histogram; `quincunx()` is shows single
layer, and `quincunx2()` is a two-stage version of the quincunx.

The bean machine, also known as the quincunx or Galton box, is a device
invented by Sir Francis Galton to demonstrate the law of error and the normal
distribution.

When a ball falls through a layer, it can either go to the right or left side
with the probability 0.5. At last the location of all the balls will show us
the bell-shaped distribution.

set.seed(123)
ani.options(nmax = 200 + 15 -2, 2)
freq = quincunx2(balls = 200, col.balls = rainbow(200))

## frequency table
barplot(freq$top, space = 0) # top layers
barplot(freq$bottom, space = 0) # bottom layers
