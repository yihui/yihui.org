This post should have been written in 2024, but [my hands were
full](/en/2026/01/hello-world/) at that time. I sadly learned from [the obituary
of Fritz Leisch](https://www.r-project.org/doc/obit/fritz.html) on the R Project
website that he passed away in April 2024.

I didn't have much direct contact with Fritz, but my career in R would have been
very different without his pioneering work on Sweave, which was the main
inspiration for me to create **knitr** later. I used Sweave extensively from
2008 to 2011. It was amazing to me that such a small piece of software could be
a game changer in data analysis workflows and reproducible research in
general---topics to which not enough people had paid attention.

One of my long-standing regrets was item #4 [in my list of
mistakes](/en/2021/03/my-mistakes/). As an arrogant young man, I was not humble
or grateful in the early days. I wrote him a thank-you note in 2020:

I didn't receive a reply, but I've learned "C'est la vie" over the years.

Jürgen Symanzik and co-authors published [a memorial for
Fritz](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00180-024-01568-0) in
*Computational Statistics* in late 2024, which included a photo of Fritz,
Jürgen, and me in Fig. 2. We were attending a data visualization workshop in
Bremen, Germany in 2008. It was my first international trip, and I got to know
many experts in the field, including Fritz, Jürgen, Michael Friendly, Lee
Wilkinson, [Nathan
Yau](https://flowingdata.com/2008/07/09/reflecting-on-the-data-viz-vi-conference/),
Antony Unwin, Simon Urbanek, and the GGobi team (Andreas Buja, Debby Swayne, Di
Cook, Heike Hofmann, Hadley Wickham, and Michael Lawrence).

Oh, too many memories, and I'm becoming nostalgic. I remember sitting next to
Lee and chatting with him on the bus back from the group dinner. Sadly, he has
also passed away ([in 2021](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leland_Wilkinson)). I
happen to be exploring the grammar of graphics recently.

For those interested in learning more about Fritz, *The R Journal* [also
published a memorial](https://journal.r-project.org/articles/RJ-2024-001/) in
2024. He will surely be missed and remembered by many people, including myself.
