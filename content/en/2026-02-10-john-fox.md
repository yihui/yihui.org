Last November, I learned the very sad news [from Michael
Friendly](https://bsky.app/profile/datavisfriendly.bsky.social/post/3m6p726a4jc2r)
that [John Fox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fox_(sociologist)) had passed
away. That brought my memory back to 2006 when I emailed John for the first time
asking for his help on a problem about Structural Equation Models (SEM), which
had puzzled me for months. I reached out to him because I had seen an appendix
on SEM (freely available on his website) in his book, *An R and S-PLUS Companion
to Applied Regression*. He patiently guided me all the way to a specific section
in Greene's *Econometric Analysis*, which finally solved my problem.

At that time, no one in the R community had heard of me, and I was just a
beginner. You can imagine how grateful I was to receive such helpful replies
from a professor at McMaster University. One funny anecdote is that when he
first told me to find the derivation in Greene's book, I quickly found a PDF
copy online (I don't remember where now), thumbed through it, and had no idea
where to find the needle in the haystack, so I asked him again and attached the
whole PDF. He was shocked because he thought I would go to a library to check
out the book. I was embarrassed, but he looked into the PDF and found the
section for me anyway. I imagine he burned the pirated copy in horror
immediately after that... When I re-read those emails today, I also feel a
little embarrassed about my poor English at the time.

My next major correspondence with John was in May 2008 when I submitted my first
English paper to *R News* (now *The R Journal*). John was the Editor-in-Chief at
the time. The paper was about the **animation** package. Again, John was very
helpful and patient during the review and editing process. I was lucky to have
him as the editor for my first English paper!

Then in August that year, I attended the useR! conference for the first time in
Dortmund, Germany. I had a chance to meet him in person in the conference hall.
I don't remember what we talked about (other than my thanking him for his help),
but my impression was that he was a very kind and humble person. Nowadays, I
rarely take pictures, but I'm glad that I brought a camera (I think it was a
Nikon) to the conference and took a picture with him:

Between 2006 and 2009, I used his famous
[**Rcmdr**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=Rcmdr) package extensively and
introduced it to many people. One reason I liked it was that although it was a
GUI package (which is usually friendly to beginners), it also showed me the R
code that was executed when I clicked on the GUI, so I could learn R this way as
well. Another package of his that I used frequently was
[**car**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=car) (in particular, the `recode()`
function, mainly because SPSS was the most popular statistical software at my
school at the time, and this feature was frequently used in SPSS).

**Rcmdr** sparked my interest in building GUI applications in R, although I
later found that Tcl/Tk was not my cup of tea. After I came to the US in 2009, I
gradually fell in love with John Verzani's **gWidgets**. Then a couple of years
later, Shiny came out, and I was naturally attracted to it. The rest is history.

Thank you, and rest in peace, John. You will be missed by many people in the R
community and beyond.
