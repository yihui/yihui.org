It's been quite a long time since I updated this site last time... In the past few weeks, I have been writing functions for the package "[animation](http://cran.r-project.org/package=animation)" and now the latest version is 0.1-4, which is under construction in my hand. I should first of all finish writing all the examples I used in the past and then the progress will be a little bit slower because I have to think about new ideas about animations in statistics -- surely this would take some time.

The examples in the web site "[Animated Statistics Using R](/animation)" will be supplemented just using my package instead of creating animation frames by R source code as before. This can lighten my burden to a large content.

BTW, I have written a special function `write.rss()` in version 0.1-4, which makes it convenient to generate a RSS feed from a CSV data file containing RSS items.
