This list of FAQs explain the technical details of TinyTeX for those who are
curious, and alternative ways to install and use TinyTeX for those who are not
sysadmins of their computers.

1.  **Which version of TeX Live is installed?**

    By default, the latest working version on Windows, macOS, and Linux, and the
    latest version on other platforms (which may work or not). Here "working"
    means the version of TinyTeX has at least passed some basic tests by
    compiling a variety of R Markdown documents to PDF. If you have to install
    an older version, please read the next FAQ.

    Note that you can install the current latest version, and choose not to
    upgrade in the future if the version happens to be stable enough for you.
    However, this means you will not be able to install or update LaTeX packages
    after the current version of TeX Live is frozen (which happens annually).

2.  **Do you provide prebuilt binaries of TinyTeX?**

    Yes, we have started to provide prebuilt binary packages for TinyTeX since
    September 2020, which can be found in the GitHub repo
    [`rstudio/tinytex-releases`](https://github.com/rstudio/tinytex-releases).
    This was made possible after two TeX Live developers explained the TeX Live
    license to me, which sounded complicated to me previously and made me
    hesitate to redistribute TeX Live as a binary package. After I knew it was
    okay to do so, I built the binaries and released them to GitHub Releases.

3.  **What is the size of TinyTeX?**

    About 84MB on macOS and 66MB on Linux (gzipped), and 99MB on Windows
    (zipped). You may think it is still too big, but please consider that the
    size of [the BasicTeX
    installer](https://www.tug.org/mactex/morepackages.html) for macOS is about
    80MB, and a [basic MiKTeX installer](https://miktex.org/download) for
    Windows is about 235MB.

    TinyTeX's small size can be very helpful if you install it on the cloud
    (e.g., for software testing purposes with GitHub Actions). The download and
    installation should take only a few seconds.

    Of course, the size of TinyTeX will grow as you install more LaTeX packages.
    You can certainly go to the extreme to install all packages (to avoid the
    possible need for figuring out which packages are missing). To do that,
    either run

    ``` r
    tinytex::install_tinytex(bundle = 'TinyTeX-2')
    ```

    in R, or if you use the [Shell/Batch script](../#installation) to install
    TinyTeX, set the environment varialbe `TINYTEX_INSTALLER=TinyTeX-2` before
    you run the script.

    This may take quite a while since it needs to download and install about 2
    GB of packages.

4.  **How is TinyTeX created? How do you reduce the size of the gigantic TeX
    Live?**

    The best way to understand TinyTeX is to read the article "[TinyTeX: A
    lightweight, cross-platform, and easy-to-maintain LaTeX distribution based
    on TeX Live](https://tug.org/TUGboat/Contents/contents40-1.html)" in
    TUGBoat. Alternatively, you can [read the
    source](https://github.com/rstudio/tinytex/) under the `tools` directory.
    Basically, TinyTeX automates the TeX Live installation using a profile file
    named
    [tinytex.profile](https://github.com/rstudio/tinytex/blob/master/tools/tinytex.profile)
    (`./install-tl -profile=tinytex.profile`), which only specifies the
    `infraonly` scheme to be installed first. With this scheme, you cannot
    really compile any LaTeX documents, but it contains the most important
    utility `tlmgr` (TeX Live Manager). At this point, the total size is less
    than 1MB (on \*nix).

    Then I use `tlmgr` to install a few more commonly used packages (defined in
    [pkgs-custom.txt](https://github.com/rstudio/tinytex/blob/master/tools/pkgs-custom.txt)).
    With these packages, you should be able to compile most R Markdown documents
    to PDF. The total size becomes about 61MB.

    The fact that I only included a small number of LaTeX packages in TinyTeX is
    one of the two reasons why TinyTeX is relatively small in size. The other
    reason is that I excluded the source files and documentation of packages. In
    `tinytex.profile`, you can see these two options:

    ``` config
    option_doc 0
    option_src 0
    ```

    Why do I exclude source files? Because they are unlikely to be useful to
    end-users. Would you really read the source code of a LaTeX package?
    Probably not, unless you are a developer or advanced LaTeX user.

    Why do I exclude the documentations? Tell me honestly: how many times have
    you found a solution via [StackExchange](https://tex.stackexchange.com), and
    how many times have you tried to read the package documentation? Even with
    the full documentation installed, you probably don't even know where to find
    these documentation files on your computer. The documentation files take a
    lot of disk space, and I believe they are rarely read by an average user, so
    they are not included. The address bar of your web browser is the most
    convenient documentation: type and search.

    If you do want to obtain the source and documentation of packages, you may
    find them [on CTAN](https://ctan.org). Alternatively, you can reinstall the
    source and documentation of a package with the command
    `tlmgr install --reinstall --with-doc --with-src <PKG>` (thanks to [the tip
    from Norbert
    Preining](https://github.com/rstudio/tinytex/pull/236#issuecomment-690789472)).

    The other major factor that affects the size of TeX Live is the font
    packages, which are usually much bigger than other LaTeX packages, but we
    cannot really do much about it, unless you do not use `pdflatex`, in which
    case you may further reduce the size of this small TeX Live distribution.

    You can use the command
    `tlmgr info --list --only-installed --data name,size` to obtain the sizes of
    all installed packages. If you have installed the R package **tinytex**, you
    can also use the function `tinytex::tl_sizes()`. For example, the size of
    the font package **lm** (Latin modern) is about 42MB!

5.  **I'm a Linux system admin. How can I install TinyTeX for all users of a
    system?**

    First, add two options `--admin --no-path` to the installation script:

    ``` sh
    wget -qO- "https://yihui.org/tinytex/install-unx.sh" \
      | sh -s - --admin --no-path
    ```

    This will install TinyTeX to `~/.TinyTeX`, and this step does *not* require
    root privileges. Then you need to add symlinks to `/usr/local/bin` via
    `sudo`, so that all users of this system can use the TeX Live executables
    (e.g., `pdflatex`):

    ``` sh
    sudo ~/.TinyTeX/bin/*/tlmgr path add
    ```

    [Some systems](https://github.com/rstudio/tinytex/issues/37) may set the
    permission of `~/.TinyTeX` to `700` by default, which means other users
    cannot really use TinyTeX (no permission to read, write, or execute anything
    in this directory). You may consider changing the owner or group of this
    directory using `chown`, and also granting write permission (plus execute
    permission on the subdirectory `bin`), e.g.,

    ``` sh
    chown -R root:staff ~/.TinyTeX
    chmod -R g+w ~/.TinyTeX
    chmod -R g+wx ~/.TinyTeX/bin
    ```

    If you want to move `~/.TinyTeX` to a different location, see FAQ 8, and
    remember to run `tlmgr path add` with `sudo` after you move the folder, to
    make sure symlinks under `/usr/local/bin` point to the the new paths
    correctly.

6.  **I'm a Linux admin. I used the above approach to install TinyTeX and added
    symlinks to `/usr/local/bin`. How can my users without root privileges
    install LaTeX packages by themselves?**

    Users without root privileges won't be able to install packages via a normal
    `tlmgr install` command, unless you have assigned them to a group that has
    write permissions to the TinyTeX root directory (by default, `~/.TinyTeX`,
    and note that `~` is *your own* home directory), in which case these users
    are able to modify the system-wide installation of TinyTeX.

    For those who do not have write permissions to the TinyTeX directory, there
    is a [user mode](https://www.tug.org/texlive/doc/tlmgr.html#USER-MODE) in
    TeX Live that allows such users to manage a user-level texmf tree, e.g., a
    user can install packages to his/her home directory instead of a system
    directory. With TinyTeX, the user-level texmf tree is at
    `~/.TinyTeX/texmf-home` (in TeX Live's terms, this is the `TEXMFHOME`
    variable, and note that `~` is the *user's* home directory).

    The first thing users have to do is to initialize the tree (create the
    `TEXMFHOME` directory if it does not exist). It only needs to be done once:

    ``` sh
    tlmgr init-usertree
    ```

    Then when they install packages, they must always use the option
    `--usermode`, e.g.,

    ``` sh
    tlmgr --usermode install koma-script xcolor
    ```

    For R users, the above commands are equivalent to:

    ``` r
    tinytex::tlmgr('init-usertree')  # again, only do this once
    tinytex::tlmgr_install(c('koma-script', 'xcolor'), usermode = TRUE)
    ```

    However, the user mode of TeX Live can actually be quite complicated, and
    unfortunately it is not something that I can help with. A few known caveats:

    -   The worst thing is that users cannot install all packages. For TeX Live,
        some packages are *relocatable*, and some are not. For example, packages
        containing executables are not relocatable (e.g., the **metafont**
        package contains the executable `mf`). If users have to use these
        packages, only the system admin can help. The good news is that the
        number of such packages is relatively small, so a conservative strategy
        is to let the sysadmin just pre-install all of them. The R function
        `tinytex:::tl_unrelocatable()` returns the names of all packages that
        are not relocatable, which is done through the call
        `tlmgr info --list --data name,relocatable`.

    -   Some packages may require running
        [`updmap`](https://www.tug.org/texlive/doc/updmap.html) after
        installation (e.g., font packages for `pdflatex`). Good news is that
        users should be able to run `updmap-user`, and bad news is that whenever
        the system admin runs `updmap-sys`, users may have to run `updmap-user`
        again (if I understand the documentation correctly). For users, the
        conservative stragety is to run `updmap-user` again when they run into
        font problems that didn't exist previously (R users can run
        `system2('updmap-user')`).

7.  **I'm a Debian/Ubuntu user. How do I prevent TeX Live from being installed
    when installing other packages that depend on TeX Live? I don't want (or
    need) both TinyTeX and the official TeX Live packages to be installed at the
    same time.**

    Yes, `apt-get install` might install certain `texlive-*` packages when they
    are dependencies of other packages (e.g., `apt-get install dvipng` will also
    install `texlive-base`). You can download and install `texlive-local.deb` to
    "fool" `apt-get`.

    ``` sh
    wget "https://github.com/rstudio/tinytex-releases/releases/download/daily/texlive-local.deb"
    sudo dpkg -i texlive-local.deb
    rm texlive-local.deb
    ```

    This package was built by running `equivs-build` on
    [debian-control-texlive-in.txt](https://github.com/scottkosty/install-tl-ubuntu/blob/master/debian-control-texlive-in.txt)
    (credits to Scott Kostyshak). Basically it pretends all `texlive` packages
    have been installed (which is not true), so that you can have the full
    freedom (and responsibility!) of choosing which LaTeX packages to install by
    yourself.

    Personally, I don't like the way that all LaTeX packages are distributed on
    Linux (e.g., Debian) as `texlive-*` packages, and each `texlive-*` package
    contains several LaTeX packages. That means you must install several other
    LaTeX packages even if you only need one. Imagine as an R user (or Python,
    or other languages): if someone pre-builds the more than 10,000 R packages
    on CRAN as 20 *collections* of packages, what do you feel when you only need
    the **ggplot2** package but are forced to install all possible packages
    related to data visualization? Obviously the advantage of providing these
    collections is that you may not need to install missing packages over and
    over again, but I'd prefer a lean TeX Live distribution and install packages
    by myself.

8.  **Can I change the installation directory?**

    The directory path is hard-coded in the installation script, and you cannot
    change it from the command line when installing TinyTeX. I chose these
    directories for Linux, macOS, and Windows because they are hidden by default
    on these platforms. TeX Live should not need (cry for) your attention in
    most cases. If you really want to change the directory, there are a few
    ways:

    -   You can download the installation scripts and modify them by yourself
        (in the spirit of open source).

    -   If you are an R user, you can install the R package **tinytex**, and
        pass a custom directory name to the `dir` argument of
        `tinytex::install_tinytex()`.

    -   Or install TinyTeX first, and move the installation folder to where
        you'd like it to be (you can even move it to a USB stick). That is
        because TinyTeX is essentially a *portable* version of TeX Live. The
        tricky part of this way is to deal with the `PATH` variable. You need to
        run the command `tlmgr path add`, but `tlmgr` won't be on `PATH` if you
        have moved the default installation directory, so you have to execute
        `tlmgr` through its full path, e.g.,

        ``` sh
        # assume you moved ~/.TinyTeX on Linux to /opt/tinytex
        /opt/tinytex/bin/*/tlmgr path add

        # assume you moved ~/Library/TinyTeX on macOS to /opt/tinytex
        /opt/tinytex/bin/*/tlmgr path add

        # assume you moved %APPDATA%\TinyTeX on Windows to C:\Software\TinyTeX
        "C:\Software\TinyTeX\bin\win32\tlmgr" path add
        ```

        You only need to do this once. If you installed TinyTeX using the
        approach in FAQ 5, you need `sudo` to run `tlmgr path add`.

9.  **How can I use TinyTeX on a USB drive or other portable devices?**

    As I said, TinyTeX is a portable version of TeX Live, so you can simply copy
    it to a portable device. The only thing you need to do after you plug the
    device to another computer is run the command `tlmgr path add`. Again, you
    need the full path to `tlmgr` in your portable device (see the the previous
    FAQ). After you run this command and restart the application, you should be
    able to run `tlmgr` without its full path.

    If you are an R user, the above steps can be done with two functions:

    ``` r
    # copy an existing TinyTeX installation (to your portable device)
    tinytex::copy_tinytex()
    # tell me where TinyTeX is on your device, and I'll run
    # tlmgr path add
    tinytex::use_tinytex()
    ```

    Note that TinyTeX installed on one platform will only work for the same
    platform, e.g., the Windows version only works for Windows. You cannot copy,
    for example, a macOS version of TinyTeX, and use it on a Windows machine.

    This is a great way to get rid of IT or system admins. You don't have to
    request them to install or upgrade LaTeX packages for you. You can do
    everything by yourself.

10. **Why doesn't the default installation path contain the year of TeX Live?**

    TeX Live installs itself to a directory named by the year by default (so
    does MacTeX), e.g., `/usr/local/texlive/2017`. I don't think it makes much
    sense to average users. Who would want multiple versions of TeX Live to be
    installed on the same computer except TeX Live developers? The full TeX Live
    is gigantic, and you probably do not want it to eat your disk space year by
    year.

    Again, if you want to change the installation path of TinyTeX, you certainly
    can.

    One TinyTeX user told me he was not aware of the fact that every year he
    actually installed TeX Live (MacTeX) to a different folder. If it were not
    for testing TinyTeX, he would never have discovered that he had got 15GB of
    TeX Live in several folders (like `/usr/local/texlive/2015`, `.../2016`, and
    `.../2017`, etc.). That confirmed my guess: users often do not know they
    installed a new version of TeX Live without uninstalling or overriding the
    installation from the previous year, so this monster just keeps growing
    every year. Yes, disk space is cheap nowadays, but that does not mean you
    have to waste it.

11. **How do I upgrade TinyTeX yearly after I had installed it in the previous
    year? I got a message like "tlmgr: Remote repository is newer than local
    (2017 \< 2018)".**

    You can install TinyTeX again, as the installation script always installs
    the very latest version. However, the currently installed LaTeX packages
    will be lost. If you want to reinstall these packages, too, you may use the
    R function:

    ``` r
    tinytex::reinstall_tinytex()
    ```

    If you do not use R, you can retrieve the list of packages and install them
    later:

    ``` sh
    TL_INSTALLED_PKGS=$(tlmgr info --list --only-installed --data name | tr '\n' ' ')
    # Then reinstall TinyTeX using the script on the homepage.
    # After TinyTeX has been reinstalled, reinstall packages:
    tlmgr install $TL_INSTALLED_PKGS
    ```

12. **Which LaTeX packages do I need to use the R package tikzDevice?**

    To use the graphical device `tikzDevice::tikz()`, you need at these LaTeX
    packages:

    ``` sh
    tlmgr install pgf preview xcolor
    ```

13. **I see a warning "not verified: gpg unavailable" every time when running
    `tlmgr`. How to get rid of this warning?**

    As the message indicates, your system does not have `gpg` (GnuPG):

    ```         
    tlmgr: package repository http://example.org/.../tlnet (not verified:
      gpg unavailable)
    ```

    For TeX Live users on Windows and macOS, the easiest way to install `gpg` is
    probably <http://www.preining.info/tlgpg/>. The "one-time installation"
    suffices.

14. **How can I install TinyTeX and/or LaTeX packages through HTTP/HTTPS/FTP
    proxies?**

    You may create a `~/.wgetrc` file (`~` denotes your HOME directory), and add
    variables `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, and/or `ftp_proxy` in it, e.g.,

    ``` config
    http_proxy=http://user:password@proxy.example.com:8001/
    ```

    See [this page on
    tug.org](https://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html) and [the
    documentation page of
    `wget`](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/html_node/Proxies.html) for
    more information.

15. **Can I use Homebrew to install TinyTeX on macOS?**

    Yes, but there are no obvious advantages, so I don't really recommend this
    approach:

    ``` sh
    brew install -v yihui/tinytex/tinytex
    ```

    The formula is in the repo
    [yihui/homebrew-tinytex](https://github.com/yihui/homebrew-tinytex) on
    GitHub. If you must use this approach, here are two caveats that you should
    know:

    -   Homebrew manages the symlinks of TeX Live (via `brew link tinytex`), and
        they are created under `/usr/local/bin`. You'd better not run
        `tlmgr path add` afterwards, because this command creates symlinks to
        the same location. When you install a TeX Live package (via
        `tlmgr install`) that contains binaries, such as **metafont** (which
        contains the executable `mf`), you should run:

        ``` sh
        brew postinstall tinytex && brew unlink tinytex && brew link tinytex
        ```

    -   After you update **tinytex** in Homebrew (e.g., via
        `brew update && brew upgrade`), the LaTeX packages that you previously
        installed by yourself will no longer be available, and you have to
        install them again. One solution is to `brew pin tinytex`, so that this
        formula won't be upgraded in the future (in fact, there should be no
        need to upgrade it). The other solution is to use the HEAD version of
        the formula:

        ``` sh
        brew cleanup -s
        brew remove tinytex
        brew install -v --HEAD tinytex
        ```

    If you feel these issues are too complicated (yes they are), just follow the
    simpler way on the [homepage](/tinytex/) to install TinyTeX on macOS.

16. **How to open a command window (terminal) to execute the commands you
    mentioned?**

    I'm not going to answer this question for Linux users. For macOS users,
    `Command + Space` to launch the Spotlight Search, and type `Terminal`. The
    first result should be `Terminal.app`. That is it. For Windows users,
    right-click the Windows icon in the taskbar and choose `Windows PowerShell`.

    If you are an RStudio user, it can be easier. RStudio has built-in support
    for terminals, and you can open a terminal right inside RStudio.
