My name is Yihui Xie. You can know more about me on the [homepage](/) and my [vitae](../vitae/). This blog is about statistics, R, graphics, life, and fun, with a special focus on R. I often update my old posts (even after years) to correct errors and remove outdated information, so please don't take everything for granted. All opinions expressed here are my own, and I don't represent anyone else. I like contributing to open-source software, especially [R](https://www.r-project.org) (I'm the author of a few R packages listed on my vitae). I have an interview on [The Setup](https://usesthis.com/interviews/yihui.xie/) where you can learn more about me on the software side.

## Contact me

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/yihui/) (where I'm active almost every day) or Twitter [@xieyihui](http://twitter.com/xieyihui) (I only read Twitter once a week). Subscribe to the RSS feed of [blog posts](../index.xml) or [all comments](https://yihui.disqus.com/latest.rss) to stay tuned. I used to provide a [guestbook](../guestbook/) page for people to leave me messages, but now I think it makes more sense just to leave comments on this page. I don't like formality, so it is not necessary to call me "Dr Xie" when you email me or introduce me to your friends. I'm a software engineer, so please don't call me professor.

Usually I don't like private emails of questions about open-source packages. It is not practical for me to answer all of them, and emails often make me feel stressed. Don't get me wrong---I do like questions, but I'll be glad to see questions about open-source packages (like R) posted on Stack Overflow, and I watch them closely almost every day. Please feel free to email me the link to your question if nobody has answered you after a few days. Knowledge should be open to the public whenever possible, and I'd like to use emails only for _private_ conversations (more explanations in [this post](/en/2017/08/so-gh-email/)). BTW, when you say you have "[a quick question](/en/2018/07/quick-questions/)", please make sure it is really quick, so I don't have to doubt if I'm too dumb.
