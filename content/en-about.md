My name is Yihui Xie. You can know more about me on the [homepage](/) and my [vitae](../vitae/). This blog is about statistics, R, graphics, life, and fun, with a special focus on R. I often update my old posts (even after years) to correct errors and remove outdated information, so please don't take everything for granted. I like contributing to open-source software like:

- [R](https://www.r-project.org): I'm the author of a few R packages (see [my vitae](../vitae/))
- [LyX](http://www.lyx.org): I maintain the Sweave and knitr modules in LyX with Jean-Marc Lasgouttes

I have an interview on [The Setup](http://yihui.xie.usesthis.com) where you can learn more about me on the software side.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/yihui/) or Twitter [@xieyihui](http://twitter.com/xieyihui) or [Google+](https://plus.google.com/u/0/109653178371807724268/posts). Subscribe to the RSS feed of [blog posts](../index.xml) or [all comments](https://yihui.disqus.com/latest.rss) to stay tuned. I used to provide a [guestbook](../guestbook/) page for people to leave me messages, but now I think it makes more sense just to leave comments on this page. I don't like formality, so it is not necessary to call me "Dr Xie" when you email me or introduce me to your friends. I'm a software engineer, so please don't call me professor.

Usually I don't like emails of questions about open-source packages, and it is not practical for me to answer all of them. Don't get me wrong --- I do like questions, but I'll be glad to see questions about open-source packages (like R) posted on StackOverflow, and I watch them closely almost every day. Please feel free to email me the link to your question if nobody has answered you after a few days. Knowledge should be open to the public whenever possible, and I'd like to use emails only for _private_ conversations.
