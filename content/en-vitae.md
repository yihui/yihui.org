## Brief Biography

Yihui Xie is a software engineer at [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com). He earned his PhD from the Department of Statistics, Iowa State University. He is interested in interactive statistical graphics and statistical computing. As an active R user, he has authored several R packages, such as **knitr**, **bookdown**, **blogdown**, **xaringan**, **animation**, **DT**, **tinytex**, **tufte**, **formatR**, **fun**, **mime**, **highr**, **servr**, and **Rd2roxygen**, among which the **animation** package won the 2009 John M. Chambers Statistical Software Award (ASA). He also co-authored a few other R packages, including **shiny**, **rmarkdown**, and **leaflet**. He has published a number of books, including "Dynamic Documents with R and knitr", "bookdown: Authoring Books and Technical Documents with R Markdown", "blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown", and "R Markdown: The Definitive Guide".

In 2006, he founded the Capital of Statistics (<https://cosx.org>), which has grown into a large online community on statistics in China. He initiated the Chinese R conference in 2008, and has been involved in organizing R conferences in China since then. During his PhD training at Iowa State University, he won the Vince Sposito Statistical Computing Award (2011) and the Snedecor Award (2012) in the Department of Statistics.

## Professional Experience

I joined RStudio as a software engineer in 2013, and have been writing software tools for data visualization, reproducible research, and automatic reporting/document generation.

I [worked on](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny/graphs/contributors) Shiny from late 2013 to mid-2015. I added a few new features to Shiny, such as the support for JavaScript libraries [DataTables](https://datatables.net) and [selectize.js](http://selectize.github.io/selectize.js/), and solved the problem with Unicode characters in Shiny apps on Windows.

From late 2014, I started working on the [**DT**](https://github.com/rstudio/DT) package for displaying tables, and **DT** is an interface to the DataTables library in both Shiny apps and R Markdown documents. At about the same time, I worked extensively on the [**leaflet**](https://github.com/rstudio/leaflet) package for interactive maps, to bring it to the HTML widgets framework. My 2015 was primarily spent on these two packages.

In early 2016, I created a new package named [**tufte**](https://github.com/rstudio/tufte), to add the Tufte style to R Markdown documents and support both HTML and PDF output formats. I started the [**bookdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) project in late 2015 to make it easier to write books and technical documents with R Markdown, and most of my time in 2016 was spent on this project. I also published a book for the **bookdown** package with Chapman & Hall/CRC in 2016.

Since late 2016, I started the [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) project, to create websites based on R Markdown. The package was finished, and the companion book was published by Chapman & Hall/CRC in 2017.

I spent the first half of 2018 on writing the book "[R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown)" (published in July), and the last few months on the R package [**pagedown**](https://github.com/rstudio/pagedown).

I was not very productive in 2019. I often felt drown in Github issues and Stack Overflow questions. There was too much maintainence work for me to do for my R packages. I planned to write the R Markdown Cookbook, but didn't finish it.

### Internship

1. Summer 2012, [AT&T Labs Research](http://research.att.com), Florham, NJ (mentor: [Simon Urbanek](http://urbanek.info))
1. Summer 2013, [Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center](http://www.fhcrc.org) (mentor: [Raphael Gottardo](http://www.rglab.org))

### Website Management

Sept 2003 - Present

I created and maintained web pages for:

- [The School of Statistics](http://stat.ruc.edu.cn), Renmin University of China (Sept 2003 - Jun 2009)
- [The Center for Applied Statistics](http://www.applstats.org), Renmin University of China (Apr 2004 - Jun 2009)
- The Center for Risk Management and Actuarial Studies (Jun 2004 - Apr 2006); Data Mining Center of Renmin University of China (Jul 2004 - Apr 2006), etc
- The "Great Expectation Society", a student society in Renmin University (Mar 2005 - Jul 2006)

I founded and have been maintaining:

- "[Capital of Statistics](https://cosx.org)", a popular online community for statistics in China (May 2006 - present)

I worked in these web studios:

- The English web studio of Renmin University of China (for the construction of English website of the university) (Sept 2006 - Jun 2009)
- The web club of the School of Statistics (as the founder & leader) (Apr 2006 - 2008)

My personal projects:

- **animation**: Animations in Statistics (<https://yihui.org/animation>)
- **knitr**: Elegant, flexible and fast dynamic report generation with R (<https://yihui.org/knitr>)

### Conference Organization

Feb 2005 - Present

I initiated the Chinese R conference in 2008, and organized

- the 1st Chinese R [conference](https://cosx.org/2008/12/1st-chinese-r-conference-summary/) (in Beijing), Dec 13~14, 2008

I helped organize these conferences:

- the 3rd Chinese R [conference](https://cosx.org/chinar/chinar-2010/) (Beijing), Jun 12~13, 2010
- the 2nd Chinese R [conference](https://cosx.org/chinar/chinar-2009/) (Beijing & Shanghai), December 2009
- Second [Conference](http://www.merit.unu.edu/MEIDE/) on Micro Evidence on Innovation in Developing Economies, April 22 ~ 23, 2008 (an international conference; I was also the Chair for the last session on April 22)
- the 2nd [Conference](http://www.applstats.org/english/io/index.htm) on Australia-China Free Trade Agreement (ACFTA): Econometric Modeling and Policy in Trade, Investment and Economic Integration, April 17th ~ 18th, 2006
- the 15th International [Conference](http://stat.ruc.edu.cn/en/21940.html) on Input-Output Techniques, June 27th ~ July 1st, 2005
- the Data Mining and Business Intelligence Conference 2006
- the International Statistics [Forum](http://stat.ruc.edu.cn/en/22120.html) 2006

### Statistical Consulting

May 2005 - Present

I offer statistical consulting by email and I have been answering questions in the [Capital of Statistics](https://cosx.org/cn/) almost every day. I'm particularly interested in these topics:

- data analysis and visualization
- theoretical problems without measure theory
- linear models, generalized linear models and nonlinear models
- R packages that I maintain (other questions on R should be asked on StackOverflow)
- statistics in other disciplines (e.g. biology) in which I can also learn something from you
- real world data mining and machine learning
- simulation
- teaching

Typically I ignore any questions on Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) or factor analysis, since I'm not convinced of their usefulness at all. I know little about time series and do not like econometrics. I have little interest in _quantitative_ research in social sciences.

## Computer Skills

I like playing with computer tools for building web pages and statistical computation & graphics. I often try to improve the efficiency of my work by creating software tools (i.e. work hard to be lazy).

- Statistical Packages: [R](http://www.r-project.org) ~~(OpenBUGS, S-Plus, SPSS, Eviews, SAS, MatLab, STATA, AMOS and LISREL)~~
- Languages: R, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL ~~(Visual Basic, VBA, VBScript, ASP, Java, C)~~
- Applications: LaTeX via [LyX](http://www.lyx.org), Markdown via [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org), databases (e.g. MySQL), ~~SVN and~~ GIT
- Operating Systems: 95% macOS, 2.5% Ubuntu, and 2.5% Windows (the latter two mostly for purposes of testing software)

Listed above are what I'm familiar with, and the ones being crossed out are due to my brain stack overflow and I do garbage collection in my brain once in a while.
